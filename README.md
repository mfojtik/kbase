# A simple knowledge sharing tool

This can be deployed on [OpenShift](http://openshift.com) as a quickstart. You
need a Ruby 1.9 application with MySQL cartridge added:

```
rhc app create kbase ruby-1.9 mysql-5.5 --from-code=https://github.com/mfojtik/kbase
```

For login, you need to have `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_SECRET_ID` set via `rhc
env`.  You can get those two when you create a new GitHub application under your
profile.

This tool use beautiful <b>Padrino</b> framework, so no Rails(!). If you experience any
problems with this tool, I'm more than happy to accept pull request.
